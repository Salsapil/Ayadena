## Project Background
Egypt has always been the cradle of civilization and the mother of industries, arts, and crafts. But over the centuries, some crafts and arts have disappeared because of the passage of many different cultures over the Egyptians and the difference in their intellectual awareness. ***Ayadena*** aspires to revive these crafts by teaching Egyptians what distinguished their ancestors for ages. To spread the culture of handcrafts and provide job opportunities for many Egyptian craftsmen at a nominal cost and to provide the experience of completely distance learning for various crafts through our website.

## Technologies Used

Our project utilized a variety of technologies for both frontend and backend development, integrating them seamlessly for a robust and interactive application.

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content on the web pages.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling and layout of the web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: Leveraged for responsive design and pre-styled components to expedite development.
- **JavaScript**: Utilized for adding dynamic behavior and interactivity to the web pages.

### Backend
- **Python**: The core programming language used for backend development.
- **Flask**: A lightweight framework used for creating the web server and handling HTTP requests.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions and management.

### Integration
- **jQuery**: Utilized to simplify HTML document traversing, event handling, and AJAX interactions.
- **AJAX**: Employed for making asynchronous requests to the server, allowing for dynamic content updates without refreshing the web page.

By combining these technologies, we were able to create a responsive, efficient, and user-friendly platform that provides a seamless experience for users.
